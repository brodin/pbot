## Getting started

1. Get your [Airtable API Key](https://airtable.com/account) and paste it into the config file:
    ```
    echo '{"key": "AIRTABLE API KEY", "base": "appJdrJKPgnOISywb"}' > config.js
    ```
2. Go nuts:
    ```
    node . start "Imaginary Pub"
    node . drink user@domain.com 10 Beer
    ```
